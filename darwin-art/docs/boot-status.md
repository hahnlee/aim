# Boot status

A living record of how far the original Android 16 userspace boots under
darwin-guest-init on the syscall layer (ADR 0012, tracking #153). Update it
with every boot-relevant change: the table, the date and the run it came
from.

## How to reproduce

```
tools/build-vendor-hals.sh
android-image assemble --original <extracted image> --manifest image/overlay.toml --out <derived>
linux-translate <derived>
guest-init --image <derived> --data <data> --run \
    --exclude zygote,surfaceflinger,vold,bpfloader --timeout 45
```

- `--exclude` keeps services (and `exec` programs) from starting. A
  `wait_for_prop` or `exec` that only an excluded service would end is
  satisfied after two seconds, as with `--only`.
- guest-init stops every service on its timeout, on SIGINT and on SIGTERM.
- The device is `darwin` (`androidboot.hardware=darwin`):
  `/vendor/etc/init/hw/init.darwin.rc` and `/vendor/etc/fstab.darwin` from
  `image/overlay.toml`. The emulator's `init.ranchu.rc` and helpers are
  removed; `android-image diff` lists them with reasons. The vendor
  `build.prop` still describes the emulator (#206).

## Debugging

The original logd runs, and every service logs to it. Read it with the
image's own logcat from another `linux-run` process:

```
tools/guest-logcat.sh [--linux-run PATH] <data>/run            # logcat -d -b all -v threadtime
tools/guest-logcat.sh <data>/run -d -s keystore2               # any logcat arguments
```

- A service's stdout and stderr (the layer's own messages: unimplemented
  syscalls, fatal signals with the faulting module) are in
  `<data>/run/logs/<service>.log`.
- Fatal signals in host code are symbolized there, for example
  `_platform_memmove+0x1bc (libsystem_platform.dylib)`.
- `linux-run --path-map <data>/run/path-map --binder
  dev.darwinart.guest-init.<pid>.binder /system/bin/service list` lists the
  registered binder services.

## Early boot (2026-09-28)

Everything but the Java world and the services noted below, on an M2 Pro.

- **Result:** 40 services running after 30 s, 48 binder services
  registered with the original servicemanager, and 8,800 lines in logd.
  With selinuxfs's classes (#203) logd holds about 1,070 lines after
  44 s instead of 9,360 after 32 s: 8,390 of those were "Unknown class".
- **Boot time:** init's queue first went idle after 12.0 s, and the last
  early service started at 13.5 s. About 8 s of that are four two-second
  grace periods for waits that only excluded or absent services end:
  - vdc `checkpoint markBootAttempt` and `prepareCheckpoint` and
    `keymaster earlyBootEnded` wait for vold;
  - `keystore.module_hash.sent` waits for keystore2, which waits for
    apexd's `apexservice`.

  Without them the early boot takes about 5.5 s.

### Services

States are init's `init.svc.*` after 30 s. "Restarting" means the service
keeps exiting and init restarts it every 5 s.

| Service | State | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| servicemanager, hwservicemanager | running | |
| logd | running | its kernel-log and audit listeners do not start (no `/proc/kmsg`, `syslog(2)` or `NETLINK_AUDIT`: #207, #201) |
| vndservicemanager | not declared | the image has no `vndservicemanager` service |
| prng_seeder | running | |
| keystore2 | running | waits for `apexservice` (`IApexService.getActivePackages`) for the module hash (#200) |
| vendor.keymint-default | running | software KeyMint |
| vendor.gatekeeper_nonsecure | running | the first start ends with SIGABRT and no log message; the restart registers `IGatekeeper/default` (#205) |
| gatekeeperd | running | |
| credstore, vendor.identity-default | running | |
| vendor.health-darwin | running | our health HAL |
| vendor.graphics.allocator | running | our allocator HAL |
| vendor.authsecret_default, vendor.cas-default, vendor.drm-widevine-hal, vendor.power-default, vendor.power.stats-default, vendor.thermal-example | running | vendor APEX HALs |
| neuralnetworks_hal_service_* (3) | running | CPU sample drivers |
| system_suspend | running | no `/sys/power/suspend_stats` |
| tombstoned | running | |
| statsd | running | |
| traced, traced_probes | running | |
| hidl_memory | running | |
| media, mediametrics, mediadrm, drm | running | |
| media.swcodec, mediaextractor | running | their minijail seccomp filters are accepted but not enforced |
| cameraserver | running | no camera HAL declared |
| installd, idmap2d, incidentd, storaged | running | |
| wificond | running | no nl80211 (`AF_NETLINK`, #201) |
| gpu | running | |
| boringssl_self_test64, boringssl_self_test64_vendor, boringssl_self_test_apex64 | exit 0 | |
| system_aconfigd_platform_init, system_aconfigd_socket_service, mainline_aconfigd_init, mainline_aconfigd_socket_service | exit 0 | |
| system_aconfigd_mainline_init | exit 1 | "aconfigd_mainline is enabled, skipping mainline init" |
| derive_sdk, derive_classpath, art_boot, logd-reinit, update_verifier | exit 0 | |
| usbd | exit 0 | no USB HAL |
| odsign | stops itself | keystore refuses the boot-level key (`Boot stage key absent`, `LOCKED`; #200) |
| misctrl | exit 1 | no `/misc` partition |
| exec `recovery-refresh` | exit 254 | no pstore |
| exec `chattr +F /data/media` | exit 1 | `FS_IOC_GETFLAGS` is ENOTTY |
| exec `otapreopt_slot` | exit 1 | not an A/B device ("Slot property empty") |
| exec `kcmdlinectrl update-props` | exit 1 | no `/misc` partition |
| lmkd | restarting (exit 0) | no PSI or memcg (P3 replaces it) |
| netd | restarting (SIGABRT) | `libnetd_updatable_init`: no cgroup v2 directory; then eBPF and netlink (#202, #201; P3 replaces it) |
| audioserver | restarting (SIGSEGV) | null dereference after "Found no HAL version": needs the audio HAL (P5) |
| vold | excluded: exit 1, then init reboots (`reboot_on_failure`) | no `NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT` socket (#201; P3 replaces it) |
| bpfloader (netbpfload) | excluded: exit 1, then init reboots (`reboot_on_failure`) | no bpffs at `/sys/fs/bpf` (#202) |
| surfaceflinger | excluded: SIGABRT | guest-init passes no `--gpu` (#204), so RenderEngine gets `EGL_BAD_DISPLAY`; with it, RenderEngine runs on ANGLE and SurfaceFlinger aborts with "failed to get hwcomposer service" (the composer is P4) |
| zygote | excluded | ART (P2) |

Every crashing process also logs "crash_dump helper failed to exec, or was
killed": debuggerd's `crash_dump64` does not run yet (#191).

### Fixed on the way

- The binder host no longer reads the argument of `BINDER_THREAD_EXIT`
  (libbinder passes 0). keystore2 crashed in the layer when a hwbinder
  thread exited.
- `/proc/self/fd` (and any synthesized `/proc` directory) has a link and
  `fstat` that match its path, so bionic's `realpath` works. prng_seeder's
  inherited-fd scan aborted.
- `/proc/mounts`, `/proc/<pid>/mounts` and `mountinfo` describe the path
  map.
- `prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER)` is accepted.
- A `#!` script as `linux-run`'s program runs its interpreter.
- guest-init plays apexd more closely: `apex.all.ready` is set at
  activation (libvintf reads the vendor APEXes' VINTF fragments only
  then), a lazy `aidl/apexservice` start no longer resets `apexd.status`,
  and `perform_apex_config --bootstrap` loads the scripts of
  `vendorBootstrap` APEXes (the gatekeeper HAL, class `early_hal`).
- guest-init resolves symlinks in the image relative to the guest root, as
  a GSI's `/system_ext -> /system/system_ext` needs.
- guest-init's shutdown stops services without running `onrestart`.
- selinuxfs has the classes and permissions of the image's policy and an
  `access` that allows everything, so `selinux_check_access` answers
  quietly (#203).
- `/dev/ashmem` exists (#195): audioserver's `MemoryHeapBase` no longer
  fails with "Unable to open ashmem device".
- POSIX timers, a writable `trace_marker` (#192), per-thread `comm` files
  (#198), and `/proc/<tid>`, the scheduler calls and `tgkill` for every tid.
- guest-init's wait for linkerconfig ends at `--timeout` and on SIGINT or
  SIGTERM (#196).
